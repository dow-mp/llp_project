# Love Local Parks

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my CodeSquad project - Love Local Parks. Check out the web app at [Love Local Parks](https://www.lovelocalparks.org).

## What is Love Local Parks?

Love Local Parks is a project that is very personal to me. I love bringing my young child to local parks and playgrounds around my community - we always have a great time playing and moving. Unfortunately, sometimes when visiting my local parks, I've noticed trash floating around the park - it gets stuck under the playground equipment, blown up against the fences, and scattered into the surrounding wooded areas. My heart breaks every time we have this experience. In the past, I've cleaned up our local park a bit here and there. It feels good to do something good for my community. 

With this website, I'm hoping to start a movement. We can all feel good about keeping our parks clean and safe. It seems to me, they just need a little *love*. 

## How to use Love Local Parks

There are two primary ways to use Love Local Parks:
* Find your local park in need and volunteer to clean it up
* Let us know your local park needs love and ask for help to clean it up

From the home page, you can navigate to the volunteer page where you can submit your information and the park's information to let us know you'll be giving it some love. Share the news on your social pages with your friends - maybe they'll even help! You can also let us know if you'd like us to share on our social media to inspire other members of your community to come by and help. 

If you have a local park that you KNOW needs some love, submit all the relevant information on the "Get Help for Your Park" page (also accessed from the home page). We'll post this information within our search page for volunteers to easily find and offer their help. 

You can also see some of our success stories linked from the home page as well. 

## The development process

I started at the bottom with the concept, sitemap, wireframes, and mood board. Next up, let's start coding! I coded the HTML portion of the site first, and then added styling to make the site accessible and responsive. I utilized Javascript to make the site as fun and interactive as possible. 

For the backend, I used Node.js with Express/EJS and MongoDB with CRUD operations to allow users to enter data via the forms, search the database, and allow admin to update and delete data as necessary.
